title: Week 3
---

Unfortunately, I went into this week with a slight cold, so I was a bit out of it on Monday and Tuesday, but it was amusing that, given this project's application in the immune system, I was thinking about the immune responses my body was putting up and how this project can model certain parts of that response. Once I was feeling better, I finalized and fixed up the formatting for the changes I made from the previous week, then I started on fixing up some of the functions throughout the program. Mainly, I followed the improvements listed on the project's README, but as I've become more familiar with the code, I've found a lot of areas that could be cleaned up and made more versatile. With the blessing of the PhD student I've been working alongside, I've been considering ways that I could modularize the tools that this program already implements well, and made it more accessible to biologist who may not have a strong computer science background. I've found that I've been able to settle into my role here smoothly, and I've really enjoyed meeting the other members of the lab as they come in-person, and it's been super nice to have other undergrads to work near during the day.
