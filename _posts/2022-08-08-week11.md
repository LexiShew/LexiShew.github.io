title: Week 10

This week, I presented my work to the whole lab group, and I finished writing and editing my final report. I'm really going to miss all the incredible people that I've met and the friends that I've made here in Houston.

I also packed everything up, and now I'm headed home to visit my family before classes start this Fall!
