title: Week 5

This week, I focused on merging in all new changes I've been making, as well as studying the constraint satifaction problem that's being solved to determine the labels of atoms of the peptide's amino acids. Merging in the changes took a lot longer than I had anticipated, but I'm glad I put in the time to test and make sure I wasn't breaking anything. This CSP isn't related to anything I've worked with before, so I ended up going through the code line-by-line to mkae sure I understand what's happening and why. I've also been reading a few more papers and getting a better sense of the current work being done in this area.

On Friday morning, I flew to Florida to visit my extended family. Though I missed the lab environment, it was nice to escape the Houston heat for a few days and spend time with family I haven't seen since before the pandemic.
