title: Week 7

At the start of this week, I spent more time working on the CSP, but didn't make much progress -- it's frustrating, but I think I'll have to settle for tidying up the code without getting much improvement in runtime. I've started looking at testing the code and comparing it the a previous version by running the previous version on a bigger dataset, which means I'm using the HPC cluster and SLURM. This was a bit of a steep learning curve, but I'm grateful that everyone in the lab was willing to provide help and resouces, and it's cool that I now know how to do it.

I'm getting a new project for my last few weeks here at Rice, so I've begun to do a bit more research into the topic. The goal is to start to implement Class II MHCs into APE-Gen, since it currently only deals with Class I MHCs. This means I've been trying to read some immunology textbooks that detail how this complexes work and how they differ from Class I. I hope I'm able to make some good progress on this project and have something substatial to show at the end of the summer!

Also, I'd like to blame the heat for making me less productive -- this is just so unnecessarily hot!
