title: Week 10
---
In my final week of work, there were a couple things I was finishing up. Firstly, I made a small dataset of cleaned-up PDB files for Class II MHCs -- the data for these structures is pretty inconsistent, so it's good to have a set of clean, usable files. I've also been working more with SLURM and the HPC cluster. The grad student I've been working with, Romanos, is planning to compare the results of this tool, APE-Gen2.0, to other pMHC modelling tools out there. To do this, he's running all of the them on the PANDORA dataset, and since he didnt have the results from APE-Gen1.0 on this dataset, I began running it. It's cool to actually understand how the Cluster works and be able to run jobs on it -- I've never had that chance before!

As I'm starting to wrap up things in the lab, it's hard to believe that 10 weeks have already passed! The bio side of the lab got lunch to celebrate my time here.
